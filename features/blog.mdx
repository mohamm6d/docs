Xeepp uses laravel-blog to allow admins create custom pages and blogs. There is one published config file `laravel-blog.php` that you can set some configs like your base template file, prefix for page and blog routes. 

## Migration
Make sure to run migrations to create required table for blog. 

## Admin
You can simple manage your pages and blog via admin panel > laravel blog.
