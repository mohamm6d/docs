Our starter kit includes an OpenAIService that allows seamless integration with OpenAI's API throughout the application. To start using the service, you need to set the required environment variables.

### Setting Up OpenAI Service
#### Set Environment Variables:
- Add your OpenAI API key to the .env file:
```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here
``` 
#### Using OpenAIService:
The `OpenAIService` can be used anywhere in your application to interact with OpenAI's API. Here is a basic example of how to use it within a controller:
```
namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use App\Services\OpenAIService;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class ExampleController extends Controller
{
    protected $openAIService;

    public function __construct(OpenAIService $openAIService)
    {
        $this->openAIService = $openAIService;
    }

    public function generateText(Request $request)
    {
        $prompt = $request->input('prompt');
        $response = $this->openAIService->generateText($prompt);

        return response()->json(['response' => $response]);
    }
}
```
