### Create an admin
After installing the application, you can create a new admin user account using the following command:
```php artisan make:admin```

You will be prompted to enter the admin name, email, and password. Once the account is created, you can access the admin panel by visiting `/admin` and logging in with your credentials.

### Allowed domains
To restrict admin panel access to users with specific email domains, add the allowed domains to your .env file under the `SUPPORTED_DOMAINS` key, using a comma-separated format.

```SUPPORTED_DOMAINS=example.com,anotherdomain.com```

### User Model 
If you need to apply specific conditions for admin accounts, modify the `canAccessPanel` method in the `User` model accordingly. This method determines whether a user has access to the admin panel.
