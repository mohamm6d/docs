Xeepp leverages Spatie Social Login to simplify the integration of various social login services into your application. To enable social logins for different platforms, follow these steps:

### Configuration
- Add Social Networks:

To support a new social network, add its configuration to the services.php file. This typically involves adding API credentials specific to each social provider.

- Set Environment Variables:

Update your `.env` file with the necessary environment variables for each social network you want to integrate. These variables include client IDs, client secrets, and redirect URLs.
- Routes
The social login functionality is managed through the following routes in your web.php:

```
Route::get('auth/{network}', [\App\Http\Controllers\Auth\AuthSocialController::class, 'redirect']);
Route::get('auth/{network}/callback', [\App\Http\Controllers\Auth\AuthSocialController::class, 'callback']);
```
- auth/{network}: Initiates the authentication process by redirecting users to the social network's login page.
- auth/{network}/callback: Handles the callback from the social network after user authentication, completing the login process.

### Example Usage
To add support for Google login, configure Google-specific settings in services.php, set the corresponding .env variables, and use the routes provided.
For detailed information on configuring each social network, refer to the Spatie Social Login documentation and the respective social providerâ€™s API documentation.
