Xeepp integrates subscription management using Laravel Cashier, providing a robust solution for handling subscriptions and billing within your application. This guide will help you understand how subscription management is implemented in your Laravel Vue starter kit.

### Overview
Laravel Cashier offers a fluent interface for managing subscription billing with Stripe and Paddle. With this integration, you can manage user subscriptions, handle recurring payments, and access billing features with ease.

### User model
Ensure that your User model uses the Billable trait provided by Cashier:
```php
namespace App\Models;

use Illuminate\Foundation\Auth\User as Authenticatable;
use Laravel\Cashier\Billable;

class User extends Authenticatable
{
    use Billable;

    // Other user model methods and properties
}
```

### Webhook
Laravel Cashier handles Stripe webhooks with a built-in controller:
```
Route::post('webhook/stripe', [\Laravel\Cashier\Http\Controllers\WebhookController::class, 'handleStripeWebhook']);
```
For Paddle, configure the endpoint similarly.
