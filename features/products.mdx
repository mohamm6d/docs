Our starter kit is packed with features to help you manage products and orders efficiently. Below is a comprehensive guide to utilizing these features within your application.

## Product and Order Management
### Admin Panel

- Create Products: Admins can create new products directly from the admin panel. This intuitive interface makes product management straightforward and efficient.
- Manage Products and Orders: The admin portal provides complete control over product and order management. Admins can view, edit, and delete products and orders as needed.
- Sharing Product Links
Order Link: Admins can generate a link to order a product by using the following route:
```
Route::get('/order/{productId}')```
This link can be shared anywhere to direct users to order a specific product.
