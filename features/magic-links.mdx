### Magic Link Authentication
Our starter kit includes a convenient magic link authentication feature using the Laravel MagicLink package. This allows users to log in without a password by requesting a magic link that is sent to their email.

### Requesting a Magic Link
Users can request a magic link to log in by visiting the login page and entering their email address. The system will send an email containing a magic link, which the user can click to gain immediate access to their account.

### MagicLinkNotification:
The package includes a `MagicLinkNotification` that handles sending the magic link email. You can customize this notification as needed.
