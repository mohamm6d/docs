To enable Stripe payments in your Laravel application using Cashier, follow these steps to set up your Stripe account and configure the necessary environment variables in your application.

### Set Up Your Stripe Account
- Create a Stripe Account:

If you don't already have a Stripe account, sign up at Stripe's website. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the registration process.

- Access Your Stripe Dashboard:

Once your account is created, log in to the Stripe Dashboard.

- Obtain API Keys:

Navigate to the Developers section on the left sidebar.
Click on API keys.
You will see two keys: Publishable key and Secret key. You will need both of these keys for your application.


### Configure Environment Variables in Laravel
- Open Your .env File:

In the root directory of your Laravel project, locate and open the .env file. If it doesnâ€™t exist, you can create one by copying .env.example:

```
cp .env.example .env```
- Set Stripe Environment Variables:

Add or update the following lines in your .env file with the API keys you obtained from Stripe:
```
STRIPE_KEY=your-stripe-publishable-key
STRIPE_SECRET=your-stripe-secret-key
```
Replace your-stripe-publishable-key and your-stripe-secret-key with the actual values from your Stripe dashboard.
