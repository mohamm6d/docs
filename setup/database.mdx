You can use any database with your application. This tutorial will guide you through the process of configuring MySQL for your setup Open the `.env` file in your favorite text editor.

### Set Your Database Connection:

Youâ€™ll need to provide the details for your database connection. Find the following lines in your .env file and update them with your database information:

```
DB_CONNECTION=mysql
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=3306
DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
DB_USERNAME=your_database_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_database_password
DB_CONNECTION: The type of database you are using (e.g., mysql, pgsql, sqlite).
DB_HOST: The address of your database server. 127.0.0.1 is used for local databases.
DB_PORT: The port number your database is running on. 3306 is the default for MySQL.
DB_DATABASE: The name of your database.
DB_USERNAME: Your database username.
DB_PASSWORD: Your database password.```
### Save the .env File:

Save your changes and close the text editor.

### Step 3: Create the Database
You need to have a database created for Laravel to connect to. You can create a database using a database management tool like phpMyAdmin or via command line. For example, to create a MySQL database from the command line:

```
mysql -u root -p```
Then enter the following SQL commands:

```
CREATE DATABASE your_database_name;
```
Replace your_database_name with the name you specified in your `.env` file.

### Step 4: Run Migrations
Laravel uses migrations to manage and version your database schema. Once your database is configured, you can run migrations to set up the necessary tables and structures.

Run the following Artisan command to execute your migrations:
```
php artisan migrate```
This command will create the tables defined in your migration files.

### Step 5: Verify the Setup
To ensure everything is set up correctly, you can test your database connection by running the following Artisan command:

```
php artisan migrate:status
```
This command will show you the status of your migrations and confirm that Laravel can connect to your database.
